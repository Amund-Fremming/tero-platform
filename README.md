### What is Tero?

Tero is a platform designed for social gatherings. At its core, it is a social gaming platform, but it is currently being developed into a hub offering much more, such as drink specials, food recommendations, and locations where you can play games in real life.


<br/>

### Architecture

The Tero ecosystem consists of several components, each with a specific role:

- **[tero-platform](https://github.com/Amund-Fremming/tero-platform)** – Written in Rust, this is the core platform that manages all Tero services. It relies on a Rust-based cache called **[gustcache](https://github.com/Amund-Fremming/gustcache)**, which I developed.
- **[tero-session](https://github.com/Amund-Fremming/tero-session)** – A microservice written in C# responsible for managing all game sessions.
- **[tero-app](https://github.com/Amund-Fremming/tero-app)** – The mobile application for iOS, developed using React Native.
