# Cases


opens app first time  -> pseudo user created  -> pseudo id stored in frontend

registration  ->  base created  ->  user is logged in with token


login new user  ->  token recieved  -> pseudo id stays the same


Pros
- now there is even no possibility for anyone to be logged in to two devices and play together
