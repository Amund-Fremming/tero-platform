## For FE

- Possibility to view redirect config (for debugging)

---

**SignalR microservice**
- [x] Create C# project with signal installed
- [ ] Create a http client for talking to rust
- [ ] Create api in c# for consuming games from rust

- [ ] Create auth0 cached client for getting token from c#
- [ ] Add core game logic in c# project

**Cleanup/refactor**
- [x] Optimize db queries by doing with tokio joins
- [x] Dynamic query builders, make a service that does this with builder pattern, now its super ugly everywhere, and hard to read
- [x] Move cache inside this repo, add syslogs when fails
- [x] Go over indexes and optimize
- [x] Create relations where possible
- [x] Cascades
- [ ] Rethink the user sync, maybe use the usertype with id, and never user guest_id. Easier lookups, faster, maybe the best solution? messy now, clients need two params every time
- [ ] query params, limit offset on lsit users
- [ ] Patch user needs update
- [ ] delete user needs to delete auth0 user also
- [ ] Webhook bug, refresh tokens treigger post login thing

- [ ] Expand refresh token / jwt to be longer than an hour
- [ ] Better handling for ServerErrors (Rows not affected, cache error)
- [ ] One endpoint to get all admin related data: stats, popup, config ??
- [ ] Error handling for client, game full/game does not exist ..

**Maybe later**
- [ ] Change webhook to use event streams from auth0, and handle events
- [ ] dedicated users for registered and guest
    - use a link from regstered to guest
    - when geeting user stats, just retain away guests users with ids in normal users
