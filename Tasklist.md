# Tasklist

## Quick notes

- Persist gamesession needs to be protected. Make singalR hub a integration, validate M2M Token

## Thoughts

- Cleanup ids: - some are uuid some are i32, and fix indexes to these if they are uuid
- Cleanup user id: - user has many ids now, decide on one sort.
- Split the fn get_subject_and_permissins into two fn, SRP

## Tasklist

- [x] Basic middleware request logger (may not need after some time, but good for debugging)
- [x] Map out all models
- [ ] Setup runtimes with .env files GITIGNORE, maybe also runtimmes for auth0, so we have separate triggers for different environments. Less pain to work with

**State**
- [x] Implement state with pg pool

**Error**
- [x] Implement descriptive error handling with internal logging not visible to the outside
- [x] Implement IntoResponse for all errors for the ServerError

- [x] Move cache out in its own reusable crate for future use
- [ ] Tests to verify that the cache works

**Generic feature**
- [x] Typed search in a handler
- [x] GenericGameService with GetGame, Typed Search

**SignalR microservice**
- [ ] Create C# project with signal installed
- [ ] Create a http client for talking to rust

- [ ] Add core game logic in c# project

**Rust connection to microservice**
- [ ] Create api in rust for consuming created games in db
- [ ] Create client for talking to C#
